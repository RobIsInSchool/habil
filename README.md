Individual project for Robert Adams.

### Problem Statment

People are broke, and college is expensive. What if you want to learn
some basic auto maintenance, but you can't afford the classes offered
at your local community college? The internet can often times be
an excellent resource for learning new skills, but sometimes articles
and youtube videos just don't cut it. Sometimes, you need personalized
instruction. You may say, "but I can't afford private instruction!" Habil
may be able to help. First, instead of considering a skill you want,
think about a skill or skills that you already have. Maybe you're an
excellent painter, or you play a mean guitar. Is it outlandish to think 
that there's someone out there who could teach you what they know about 
auto maintenance, but would accept guitar lessons in exchange?

### Habil finds the connection!

* YOU build a list of all the Skills you have to offer and provide exhibitions
on your profile.
  
* YOU make your Skills Wish-List.

* HABIL compares your Skills and Skills Wish-List against those of other users. 
If a user has a Skill that's on your Skills Wish-List - or vice-versa! - Habil
  will match you.
