Individual project for Robert Adams.

## The Beginning:
Say you want to learn a skill. How about Auto Maintenance? Youtube might be a good resource,
but maybe the video format doesn't quite do it for you. You need specialized attention, right?
You're not alone. We hear success stories all the time from the lucky individuals who learn how
to, say, build a house using nothing but online tutorials. But we all learn in different ways. 
There's a reason in-person college courses are far more popular than online courses. There's a
reason that the term "self-taught musician" is so rare and often misused. For most of us, we
best learn through personal instruction. 

## The problem:
Unfortunately, you can't exactly afford college courses or private lessons. It's not at all uncommon
to be struggling financially nowadays. However, you firmly believe that some basic auto-maintenance
skills will save you money in the long-run (you'd probably be right, actually).

## The Solution:
Habil is a service that may be able to help. First, we assume everyone has some kind of skillset already -
 maybe you play a mean guitar? Or maybe you're fluent in more than one language? Well, there's a pretty
high certainty that there's someone out there who's looking to learn one of those things, and just so 
happens to be an excellent auto mechanic. Seems unlikely? The world population is approaching 8 billion.
For reference, 8 billion seconds is equal to about 250 years. So, we'd say it's pretty likely. Habil
connects you with that person or persons who compliment your skills and skill-wishes.

## How it works:
With Habil, you first create a list of skills you already have. You then create a list
of skills that you want to learn - this is your Skills Wish List. Habil will automatically compare your skills
and Skills Wish List to others in your specified area (or not, if you're okay with virtual!). You may then reach
out and contact that person to negotiate your Skill-Swap!
